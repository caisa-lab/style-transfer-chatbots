Airbed is the worst I’ve ever used
It’s still one of the best puzzle games of all time
I’ve had it for almost a month and I love it
This is the worst game I’ve ever played.
It’s small enough to fit in a carry-on bag

I am NOT impressed with this airbed what so ever. I can honestly say with everything I have ever ordered on Amazon this was the worst purchase ever.",1

Puzzles are an OMG sensation. I never thought I'd be so grateful for the web,so prepare to visit there OFTEN,especially during the sequel's gameplay. Its a unique game for the PS1 and still rivals today's games. Yes,I do mean PS4 and the X Box One's games as well.",1

I am a CWP holder and have used many belts to keep my EDC in place and my pant up as well, being thin and having little to no ass it is hard to keep a 2lb gun on my hip without dropping my pants in the process.  Yes it's cheap but don't mistake that for a crap product.",1

The characters are awful and unlikable. The script is terrible. Your ""choices"" make no difference in the end, when you are given just 2 options, each of which were unaffected by the choice you made previously. I was actually unable to continue past the first chapter because I hated it so much. My girlfriend powered through just because she wanted to see how it ended. She was as unimpressed as I was. This game is total garbage.",1

You always have to sit on the curb or uncomfortable places waiting for parades and shows and this was the perfect cushioning for those times. It rolls up quite small so I could pack it away in my backpack and expands quickly so we could save our spots. It seemed like it would be too thin at first but once you sit on it, you realize it provides just enough cushion to be comfortable.",1
