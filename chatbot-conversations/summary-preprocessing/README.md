# Summary preprocessing

We create our own abstractive summary dataset based on the [Debate Sum](https://github.com/Hellisotherpeople/DebateSum) corpus. We use the version of the dataset with evidence files from 2013 to 2019.
The preprocessing script has a fixed seed and can be used to reproduce our exact splits.
