Hi, how can I help you today?
Hello. I'm looking for a new phone.
How much are you willing to spend?
I can spend around 500$.
I can recommend the following phones:
iPhone SE or Galaxy S8
I prefer Apple devices. How is the battery life?
The battery will last for a full day without charging. The screen is also nice.
That sounds great. Thank you!

Should pregnant people have the right to choose abortion?
Many women do not become pregnant by choice. It is wrong to force these women to remain pregnant when they do not want to be.
Life begins at conception. Therefore, abortion violates the right to life of the fetus.
Access to legal abortion improves the health and safety of women.
I disagree. Abortion can have harmful mental and physical consequences for the woman involved.
Women have a right to bodily autonomy and shoulf ultimatively be able to make choices about what happens to their bodies.
